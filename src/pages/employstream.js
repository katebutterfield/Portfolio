In fact, the company created an entire job dedicated to building forms for customers because <span class="es-highlight">the old tool was time consuming, difficult to use, and involved a steep learning curve.</span></p></li></ScrollAnimation>
          <ScrollAnimation animateIn="fadeInUp" duration=".5" animateOnce="true"><li><h4>SOLUTION</h4><p>I did a complete overhaul of the form building process, transforming the product into <span class="es-highlight">a self-serving and visual way for staffing firms to build forms.</span> I decided on a drag-and-drop format which allows each field type to act as a building block on the page, a concept that is easy to grasp even with no technical background.</p></li></ScrollAnimation>

        <h4>Initial Form Setup</h4>
        <p>This is historically the most difficult part of the process because users don't know where to start. I created a clear landing area for each field type so the user knows where to drag and drop them, and can visualize the end result based on the layout of this page.</p>
        <img src={require('../images/form-empty.jpg')}/>
        <h4>Flexible Layout</h4>
        <p>Previously, the system could only create single-column forms. With this new design, users are able to switch between a full/half column layout for fields like "First Name" and "Last Name" which make sense placed side by side.</p>
        <img src={require('../images/form-columns.jpg')}/>
        <h4>Drag and Drop</h4>
        <p>To allow for more flexibility, this design supports the ability to reposition fields on the page by dragging and dropping them to snap into place.</p>
        <img src={require('../images/form-drag.jpg')}/>
        <h4>Conditional Logic</h4>
        <p>If 'this' then 'that' - This is the basic idea behind conditional formatting. I built this functionality into the "Logic" tab on the side bar so the user can configure this formatting while simultaneously viewing their changes on the form.</p>
