          <li><h4>PROBLEM</h4><p>EmployStream's Customer Success team was spending hours on the phone training each customer how to build forms for contracts, payroll, and new hire onboarding. In fact, the company created an entire job dedicated to building forms for customers because the old tool was time consuming, difficult to use, and involved a steep learning curve.</p></li>
          <li><h4>SOLUTION</h4><p>I did a complete overhaul of the form building process, transforming the product into an self-serving and visual way for staffing firms to build forms. I decided on a drag-and-drop format which allows each field type to act as a building block on the page, a concept that is easy to grasp even with no technical background.</p></li>

        <h4>Initial Form Setup</h4>
        <p>This is historically the most diffuicult part of the process because users don't know where to start. I created a clear landing area for each field type so the user knows where to drag and drop them, and can visualize the end result based on the layout of this page.</p>
        <img src={require('../images/form-empty.jpg')}/>
        <h4>Flexible Layout</h4>
        <p>Previously, the system could only create single-column forms. With this new design, users are able to switch between a full/half column layout for fields like "First Name" and "Last Name" which make sense placed side by side.</p>
        <img src={require('../images/form-columns.jpg')}/>
        <h4>Drag and Drop</h4>
        <p>To allow for more flexibility, this design supports the ability to re-position fields on the page by dragging and dropping them to snap into place.</p>
        <img src={require('../images/form-drag.jpg')}/>
        <h4>Conditional Logic</h4>
        <p>If 'this' then 'that' - This is the basic idea behind conditional formatting. I built this functionality into the "Logic" tab on the side bar so the user can configure this formatting while simultaneously viewing their changes on the form.</p>
