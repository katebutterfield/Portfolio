          <li class><h4>SOLUTION</h4><p>
          I decided to approach the problem with 3 main solutions: Personalization, visual hierarchy, and persuasive design.</p>
          <h5>Personalization:</h5><p> Display elements that are unique to the user, such as their individual projects and stats regarding user activity. This tackles the relevance issue in the original design.</p>
          <h5>Visual Hierarchy:</h5><p>Following atomic design methodology - I decided to break each section into a separate card/widget to create a dashboard comprised of only important information. Based on user research, the most used features are conveniently placed at the top of the page.
          </p>
          <h5>Persuasive Design:</h5><p>Nudging the user towards taking action on certain features produces better feature adoption - I did this by using small notification dots and empty states that show the users what they're missing.

        <h4>Suggested Candidates</h4>
        <p>Suggestions offer users the ability to discover new candidates they might not see in a regular search by surfacing profiles related to candidates they've taken action on.</p>

        <img src={require('../images/entelo-browser-projects.jpg')}/>
        <h4>Messaging</h4>
        <p>Users love tracking their engagement on messages sent to candidates, so I bundled the most important stats and activity regarding their messaging to display on the homepage.</p>
        <img src={require('../images/entelo-browser-messaging.jpg')}/>
        <h4>Activity</h4>
        <p>For some familiarity to the old homepage, I kept an activity feed on the page to show users how other people on their team are currently using Entelo.</p>

        <h4>Achievements</h4>
        <p>Gamification encourages users to be more active on the platform. To spark this productivity, I decided to display the user's latest badge along with their progress towards the next one. </p>

        <h4>Searches</h4>
        <p>Some space was preserved to display the user's saved/ recent searches. When talking to users, I determined that they like having the option to access this from the homepage. </p>
